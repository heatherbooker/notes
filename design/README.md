# Design

### 3 Main Principles

1. Composition
2. Colour
3. Typography

1. Components of Composition
- colour, spacing, size, contrast, direction, and more

#### Why draw by hand?

In learning stages, it lets you rapidly practice composition (and other lesser elements like form).

In the real world, it allows you to rough things out quickly, like logos and characters.

### Tools

- XD (Windows/Mac)
- Illustrator (Windows/Mac): useful for making graphics

### How to Learn to Design

Step 1: COPY.

Step 2: MODIFY.

Step 3: REPEAT. 5ever.

### Soak up Art

Also critique, commentate it, understand what it means and how it makes people feel.

Look at [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), watch Disney, whatever. [Drawfee](https://www.youtube.com/user/Drawfee) is a Youtube channel with some interesting videos - pay attention to their use of colour, low and hi lights, and crisp linework.

Studies:

Feature: the door on the right is large and colourful yet in the background, which makes the composition balanced because you have a similar door-shaped monster on the left.
