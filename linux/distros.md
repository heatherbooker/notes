## Linux Distros and Desktops

### Distros

A Linux distribution is basically defined by its package manager. For example:  
- Ubuntu, Mint : apt-get
- Fedora : yum
- Arch: pacman  

These distros may or may not ship with some software included.

### Desktops

- less resource-intensive
- Unity (used by Ubuntu) is a graphical shell around Gnome

KDE
